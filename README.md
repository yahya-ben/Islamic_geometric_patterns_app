![App Logo](app_logo.png)

This mobile app was developed as our final year project in the Faculty of Sciences, Rabat, under the supervision of Prof. [Supervisor's Name]. It is designed to provide a convenient tool for generating Islamic geometric patterns.

## Features

- **Pattern Generation**: The app offers a wide range of tools and algorithms to create intricate and beautiful Islamic geometric patterns. Users can explore various design options, including different shapes, symmetries, and color schemes.

- **Customization**: Users can customize the generated patterns by adjusting parameters such as line thickness, color gradients, and background colors. This allows for endless creative possibilities and ensures that each pattern is unique.

- **Save and Share**: The app allows users to save their favorite patterns to their device's gallery or share them directly with others via social media platforms. This feature encourages users to showcase their designs and promotes community engagement.

- **Pattern Library**: The app comes with a built-in pattern library that offers a collection of pre-designed patterns. Users can browse through the library for inspiration or use these patterns as a starting point for their own creations.

- **Educational Resources**: To enhance the user's understanding of Islamic geometric patterns, the app provides access to educational resources, including articles, tutorials, and videos. These resources aim to deepen the user's knowledge and appreciation of this art form.
